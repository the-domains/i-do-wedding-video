            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lynette + Hector Extended-Cut</h1><p>This was one of the nicest families we have ever shot. Rene and I felt like one of the family members and had a great time watching the events unfold. This group was ready to party, once the events were finished... and if we did not have a long drive home, we might have stayed!</p><img src="http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/540537818_1280.jpg"></article>]]></description>
